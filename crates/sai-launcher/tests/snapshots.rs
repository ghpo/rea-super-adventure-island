//! Golden snapshots (docs/STANDARDS.md, "Golden snapshots"): everything the
//! launcher produces, compared with the files in `tests/snapshots/`, so an
//! SDK bump or a refactor can't change it silently. A diff is reviewed like
//! code: it must match an intended change or an SDK Migration item.
//!
//! `REA_UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1 cargo test --test snapshots` rewrites them; the
//! SDK helper stores this crate's version as `<version>`, so a release bump
//! never breaks them. Add a snapshot for every file, registry value,
//! environment variable and argument list a look writes as the launcher
//! grows (the plan of each look).
