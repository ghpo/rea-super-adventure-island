//! The private runtime copy of the game folder (`rea_launcher::runtime`).
//!
//! The player's folder is only read. The launcher brings its files into a
//! runtime folder of its own and changes only that copy: every write there
//! is a whole-file swap (`rea_launcher::fsx`). [`GamePolicy`] says which
//! files are large read-only data (hard-linked when the disk allows),
//! which the game writes itself (never overwritten once present: saves,
//! its own settings) and which the launcher places (components, generated
//! configuration). Fill it in from Phase 2 of the playbook.
