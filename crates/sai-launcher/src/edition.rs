//! Which builds of SuperAdventureIsland.exe this launcher knows, by SHA-256
//! (`rea_launcher::identify`).
//!
//! Every edition the owner has (retail, GOG, Steam, regional, patched) gets
//! a row in [`EDITIONS`], from the hashes taken in the playbook's Phase 2.
//! Any other build is refused with its digest and the link to the
//! "unknown edition" issue template, so players can report it
//! (docs/STANDARDS.md, "Every edition"). Nothing is ever patched by
//! guesswork.
